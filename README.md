## What is this API used for?
This is one of three microservices that make up Dash, and provides it with a basic bank containing data with customers and sample transactions. The service is used, for example, with [conversation-server](https://github.com/dash-bot/conversation-server) for use with Microsoft Cognitive Services' LUIS when customers query it for information regarding their accounts.
